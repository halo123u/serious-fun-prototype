# Serious Fun Admin Prototype(CMS)

#### The Master Minds
- Oswaldo Almazo
- Asher Shaheen
- Muhammad Abubakar 

## Description 
The proto-type is a CMS interface allowing the Admins of the website to make changes to their websites. In this case, the content is different schools and classes. The CMS gives the admin full _CRUD_ ability to manage their content.

## User Stories ( M V P )
  *  USER should be able to login as admin
  *  USER should be able to add/edit/delete _SCHOOL_ and _CLASS_
  *  USER should be able to upload a picture for classes
  *  USER should be able to view changes immediately on their _LIVE WEBSITE_

## Our Approach
We realized that our client wanted the full accessibily to change content on their current website. We utilized _REACT.JS_ to build our frontend and served the backend with _MONGO_. This allowed us to store all of their content in _MONGO DB_, fetch and serve the UI with _REACT.JS_

## Sourced Technologies
-  [x] React.js  
-  [x] Express / Node.js 
-  [x] Mongo DB  
-  [x] BootStrap
-  [x] Cloudinary (upload and save images)

## Current Tasks
-  [] Classes & Schools relations in the DB
-  [] About us - Page to serve the schools & classes
-  [] Moving Cloudinary Image uploading to the _BACKEND_
